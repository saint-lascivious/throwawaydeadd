saint-lascivious (Hayden Pearce) Â©2023

A simple generic yet flexible `keepalived` check and/or notify script.

### Features
- Simple filename based operation

..Monitor (and optionally take action on) a service as easily as creating a symbolic link.

..`throwawaydeadd` operates as either a check or notify script depending on the extension used for the script or symbolic link.

- Low dependencies

..Simple bash shell construction.

..Requires only `systemctl` and `date` commands.

- Configurable

..External configuration can be provided from a file with the same name as the check and or notify script/symbolic link, located within the same working directory as the script or symbolic link.

- State and lock file enhanced logic

..Reduced potential for state flapping or "ping-pong".

..Prevents multiple simultaneous executions of the same script or "timeout runaway" which can be typical in high run frequency scenarios.

- Action packed

..Perform one of many `systemctl` actions depending on the current state of the service being monitored, up to/including (re)starting or stopping that service or even the host server itself.

# [Script](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/throwawaydeadd/tree/master/script "Link to script folder")

## Install throwawaydeadd
All commands given are assumed to be run as `root` or equivalent (with `sudo`).

Create the directory `throwawaydeadd` and its symbolic links will live:
```
mkdir /etc/scripts
```

Navigate to that directory:
```
cd /etc/scripts
```

Download the `throwawaydeadd` script using `wget`:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saint-lascivious/throwawaydeadd/master/script/throwawaydeadd
```

Review or modify the script if desired, and ensure it is executable:
```
chmod +x throwawaydeadd
```

The basename and file extension will dictate the service to monitor and the function to perform respectively.

The service name MUST be an exact match, and the extension MUST be one of `check`, `CHECK`, `notify` or `NOTIFY`.

All examples going forward will assume that the service to be monitored is named `Example-Service`.

Example:
```
ln -s /etc/scripts/throwawaydeadd /etc/scripts/Example-Service.check
ln -s /etc/scripts/throwawaydeadd /etc/scripts/Example-Service.notify
```

To indicate that they should function as a MASTER server rather than a BACKUP server at a system/host rather than script/symbolic link level, MASTER server(s) MAY create a dotfile trigger in the same directory as the script or symbolic link.

Example:
```
touch /etc/scripts/.is_master_server
```

## Configure throwawaydeadd
External configuration may be supplied via a configuration file in the `/etc/scripts/` directory, with the same name as the service being monitored.

Example `/etc/scripts/Example-Service.conf` shown here with default values (master:false, active:none, inactive:start and failed:restart):
```
IS_MASTER="false"

MASTER_IS_BACKUP_ACTIVE="none"
MASTER_IS_BACKUP_INACTIVE="start"
MASTER_IS_BACKUP_FAILED="restart"

BACKUP_IS_BACKUP_ACTIVE="none"
BACKUP_IS_BACKUP_INACTIVE="start"
BACKUP_IS_BACKUP_FAILED="restart"

MASTER_IS_MASTER_ACTIVE="none"
MASTER_IS_MASTER_INACTIVE="start"
MASTER_IS_MASTER_FAILED="restart"

BACKUP_IS_MASTER_ACTIVE="none"
BACKUP_IS_MASTER_INACTIVE="start"
BACKUP_IS_MASTER_FAILED="restart"

MAX_STATE_AGE="4"
STATE_DIR="/var/log"
```

`IS_MASTER` may be set to `true` on a case by case basis via this KEY=VALUE pair or system wide via an `.is_master_server` dotfile trigger located within the same directory as the script or symbolic link, the default value is `false`.

`SERVER_IS_ROLE_SERVICE-STATE` variables may be ONE (1) of the following.

Options performed on services in the form of `systemctl $option Example-Service`:
`disable`, `enable`, `mask`, `reenable`, `reload`, `reload-or-restart`, `reset-failed`, `restart`, `start`, `stop` and `unmask`.

Options performed in the form of `systemctl $option`:
`daemon-reexec`, `daemon-reload`, `hibernate`, `reboot`, `poweroff`, `suspend` and `suspend-then-hibernate`.

Note that not all options may be possible on all host servers.

Null options:
`none` or blank/unset, do nothing and exit with a success status.

Any other string is rejected and will result in an abort with `exit 1`.

`MAX_STATE_AGE` is the time in seconds a service state derived from a state file should be considered fresh, the default value is `4` (FOUR) seconds.

`STATE_DIR` is the directory in which `.state` and `.lock` files should be kept, the default value is `/var/log`.

# [Config](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/throwawaydeadd/tree/master/config "Link to config folder")
MASTER to BACKUP failover, with fast fall and slow rise.

The following examples assume that the service to be monitored is `Example-Service`, that there is a MASTER running on `192.168.1.10` and a BACKUP running on `192.168.1.20`, and that the virtual router IP address is `192.168.1.99` on the `eth0` interface.

The example service is checked with an interval of `5` seconds, and a timeout of `4` seconds. The advertisement interval is `1` second. The priority of an instance will fall after `2` successive failures (`10` seconds), and only rise again after `12` successive successes (`60` seconds).

The MASTER has a starting priority of `150`, and the BACKUP has a starting priority of `145`. The weight value is `-10`.

The default shared password is `default`.

The Virtual Router ID (`99`) reflecting the final digits of the Virtual IP Address (`192.168.1.99`) is strictly for convenience/memory association.

Once again, any/all instances of `Example-Service`/`EXAMPLE_SERVICE` used in the examples should be replaced with the exact (case sensitive) service name to whose state you wish to attach your virtual IP address.

    interval 5
    weight -10
